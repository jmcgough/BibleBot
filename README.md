# BibleBot
TwitterBot sends a Bible verse when it sees hashtag #bverse sent to it.

This is my first TwitterBot, it is meant to send a Bible verse as a reply to any
Tweet/Message sent to it with the hashtag #bverse.

It requires Tweepy a Python Twitter API. http://www.tweepy.org/
It also requires Requests: HTTP for Humans, I am not sure if it is installed
by default with Python or not: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

I have "*borrowed*" a lot of code from the web while learning how to make this
bot work, from the Tweepy docs and various helps from Stack Overflow.
Thanks and Props to all!

I am looking forward to seeing improvements, as well I wanted to make this
available to others that might want to build a TwitterBot and needed a place
to start.

Feedback is always welcome!

Thanks,

Jeffrey McGough
